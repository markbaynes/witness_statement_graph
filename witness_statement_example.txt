Paragraph 19
54 In April 2015 a LBTH property (9B Burslem Street) came under attention of investigators working on the Youth Service corruption case (#589). The property was controlled by Cllr Shaled Ali but the address was also used by a number of fictitious organisations (e.g. Young Routes and CTUK) which had received funds from the Youth Service. On 1 December 2015 the possession of the property was recovered and secured by LBTH officers following complaints by local residents (#648). During this recovery exercise a large quantity of drugs was found. Further work by trading standards also identified other companies operating from the premises, including Stolen Land Limited (#649/#650). I referred this information to Andy Bamber on the same day (2 December 2015) confirming that the company directors (Khaled Sadique and Thamemul Haque) were members of the Youth Service (#651).
55 A couple of months later (3 February 2016) as part of another investigation (involving Ali Zaman and CTUK) I interviewed Khaled Sadique as a witness as I had identified him being included in email correspondence relating to a fictitious organisation (#652). At the meeting Khaled Sadique reported having worked for CTUK and having knowledge of its work. Following this I emailed him to request further information relating to a number of funding proposals (#671). I sent some further questions for clarification to him on 8 and 10 February 2016 (#668 - 670). by late February 2016 it became clear that he could not support all the assertions he had made and I detected that he was attempting to lay down an audit trail which appeared to be suggesting that I had threatened him and bullied him into participating in the investigation (#666). Due to the nature of the email I responded on 29 February 2016 to clarify my role and the investigation process and assured him of my impartiality (#665-666). At around 08:40 I then received a telephone call from Khaled Sadique in which he attempted to distort what I had previously said to him, accused me of being an ex-police officer and that he was afraid of me. At the end of the call I drafted a contemporaneous note as a record of the conversation (#664). a few minutes later I received an email from Khaled Sadique reported that he had issued a grievance against me (#665). As a result I emailed Andy Bamber and Karen Davis to alert them of the grievance and its malicious intent (#664).
56 On 3 March 2016 Khaled Sadique emailed Karen Davis issuing a Combatting Harassment and Discrimination (CHAD) complaint in which he makes a direct reference to my investigatory actions being racially motivated and making allegations of falsifying information and serious malpractice (#673). I attended a meeting with Andy Bamber and Karen Davis on 4 March 2016 where Andy Bamber informed me that he had discussed the issue with LBTH Directors and the CEO (i.e. Steve Halsey and Will Tuckley) who had agreed that I be removed from the investigation and should be handled over to Steve Wiggett. As a consequence, I emailed Andy Bamber and Karen Davis on 6 April 2016 to express my surprise at this decision and lack of support provided by them for an unsubstantiated and malicious allegation and issued my own CHAD (#685). Andy Bamber responded the same day informing me that he would address it on his return from holiday (#685).
57 After a couple of non-scheduled short meetings with Andy Bamber following his return from holiday, on 15 April 2016, in which he attempted to intimidate me (by saying what I had done was career suicide), I emailed him to inform him that I would withdraw my CHAD if I received a written apology from Khaled Sadique (#684-685). On 19 April I received a response from Andy Bamber which suggested he had not engaged in any dialogue with Khaled Sadique, despite me initiating my CHAD two week before on 6 April 2016 (#684). On 23 April 2016 Andy Bamber emailed me to inform me that he had asked Steve Wiggett to take over the investigation and asked me to pass over all the information to assist him (#684). On 25 April 2016 I emailed Andy Bamber to confirm if he had any response from Khaled Sadique regarding my request for an apology (#683). To which Andy Bamber responded the same day stating I did not understand the complexity of the situation (#683). As I was puzzled by his response I responded (on 28 April 2016) saying all I had requested was an apology to enable me to withdraw my CHAD and provided a deadline for receiving an apology by 4 May 2016 or I would continue with the CHAD.
58 During this week I took a couple of days off work sick with a bout of flu. I was very surprised that on my return to work Andy Bamber emailed me (23 April 2016) to discuss my absence from work (#694). I responded (25 April 2016) stating I was happy to meet but requested that care be taken not to conflate my absence from work with the issues relating to Khaled Sadique (#694). At the sickness review meeting I reiterated my position and repeatedly confirmed my absence was not due to the current situation. No further action was forthcoming from Andy Bamber regarding this issue.
59 On 29 April 2016 Andy Bamber emailed me to inform me that he was on sick leave and was unable to address my demands concerning Khaled Sadique (#701). He never returned to work. Two months later (on 28 June 2016) I emailed Karen Davis to enquire about an update in respect of my CHAD (#707). On 30 June 2016 she responded stating she could not provide an update in Andy Bamberâ€™s absence but informed me of a management restructure in the coming months and as such my complaint would be picked up later (#707). I did not receive acknowledgement or any further communication about my CHAD until four months later, on 2 December 2016 (#1299). At a meeting held on 30 January 2017 with senior HR representatives, Mark Keeble confirmed in a letter dated 7 February 2017 that this CHAD should have been referred to another manager and it was too late to address the situation (#1299).
60 In November 2015 I joined Trade Union due to the problems I was facing.
